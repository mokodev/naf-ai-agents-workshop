    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). At its core, LangGraph provides a graph-based approach to orchestrating workflows where data flows through nodes connected by edges. Think of it like a network diagram - but instead of routers and switches, you have processing nodes that transform state as it moves through your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of LangGraph without worrying about LLMs or APIs. We'll focus on understanding the core concepts using simple network automation examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph Matters for Network Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a structured workflow framework:\n",
    "- Complex automation logic becomes spaghetti code with nested if/else statements\n",
    "- State management is error-prone and hard to debug\n",
    "- Adding new steps or changing workflow order requires significant refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph:\n",
    "- Workflows are visual and easy to understand (nodes and edges)\n",
    "- State is explicitly defined and flows predictably through the graph\n",
    "- Adding, removing, or reordering steps is as simple as modifying the graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",

    "## 2. State - The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is State?\n",
    "\n",
    "**State** is a shared data structure that holds the current information or context of your entire LangGraph application. In simpler terms, it's like your application's memory where it keeps track of variables and data that nodes can access and modify as they execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of state like the information that needs to be tracked during **SCM address object creation**. When a network administrator creates address objects in Strata Cloud Manager, they need to track multiple pieces of information throughout the process:\n",
    "- The address object name\n",
    "- IP address or FQDN value\n",
    "- Which folder to deploy to\n",
    "- Description and tags\n",
    "- Validation status\n",
    "- Whether the object was created successfully\n",
    "- Any errors encountered\n",
    "- Current step in the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This information needs to persist and be accessible throughout the entire configuration workflow. Each task in the workflow (parsing input, validating data, creating the object in SCM) can read this information and update it. That's exactly what **State** does in LangGraph - it's the shared data that flows through your workflow, being read and updated by each step (node).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About State\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared Data Structure**: All nodes can access and modify the same state\n",
    "- **Application Memory**: Keeps track of variables and data throughout execution\n",
    "- **Type-Safe**: Using TypedDict ensures you know exactly what data exists\n",
    "- **Centralized**: All information your workflow needs is stored in one place\n",
    "- **Flows Through Workflow**: Each step receives state, processes it, and returns updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why State Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "State is the backbone of your LangGraph application. Without properly defined state:\n",
    "- Each step doesn't know what information is available from previous steps\n",
    "- Type errors happen at runtime instead of development time\n",
    "- Debugging becomes difficult because data flow is unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "With well-defined state:\n",
    "- Every step knows exactly what data is available\n",
    "- IDEs provide autocomplete for state fields\n",
    "- Data flow is explicit and easy to trace\n",
    "- You can see the complete status of your workflow at any point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progressive Complexity in State Design\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build more sophisticated workflows, your state schemas will evolve. Here's how state complexity typically progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Complexity | Fields | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|--------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Level 1** | Simple (2-3 fields) | `name`, `ip_netmask`, `folder` | Basic address object creation |\n",
    "| **Level 2** | Moderate (4-6 fields) | Add: `validated`, `error_message`, `created` | With validation and tracking |\n",
    "| **Level 3** | Complex (7-10 fields) | Add: `description`, `tags`, `object_id`, `current_step` | Full lifecycle tracking |\n",
    "| **Level 4** | Advanced (10+ fields) | Add: `api_response`, `errors` (list), `metadata`, `timestamps` | Production-ready with audit trail |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: Start at Level 1-2 for learning, move to Level 3-4 for production workflows."

    "\n",
    "### What is a Node?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes** are individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within your LangGraph workflow. Each node receives an input (typically the current state), processes it, and produces an output (an updated state).\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Parse Station**: Extracts address object details from user input\n",
    "2. **Validation Station**: Validates IP formats, required fields, and folder existence\n",
    "3. **Preparation Station**: Formats data according to SCM API requirements\n",
    "4. **Creation Station**: Makes the API call to create the object in SCM\n",
    "5. **Verification Station**: Confirms the object was created and retrieves its ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Each station does one specific job. The configuration data moves through each station, and at each stage something specific happens to it. That's exactly what nodes are - each node performs one specific task in your workflow.\n",

    "### Key Points About Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Functions**: Each node is a Python function with a single responsibility\n",
    "- **Receives State**: Nodes get the current state as input\n",
    "- **Processes Data**: Performs a specific operation (validation, API call, decision logic)\n",

    "## 4. Graph and Edges - Connecting the Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is StateGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss edges, let's understand **StateGraph** itself - this is one of the first and most important elements you'll interact with when building LangGraph applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**StateGraph** is the builder and compiler for your graph structure. Its main purpose is to:\n",
    "- Build and compile the graph structure\n",
    "- Manage nodes, edges, and overall state\n",
    "- Ensure the workflow operates in a unified way\n",
    "- Make sure data flows correctly between components\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of StateGraph like a **configuration management playbook template**. Just as a well-designed playbook template outlines the procedure, defines all the steps, and shows how they connect together, StateGraph defines the structure and flow of your workflow. Before you can execute configuration changes in SCM, you need the playbook. Before you can run a workflow, you need StateGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms:\n",
    "- **Playbook template** = StateGraph (defines structure)\n",
    "- **Individual tasks** = Nodes (steps in the workflow)\n",
    "- **Task dependencies** = Edges (connections between steps)\n",
    "- **Executing the playbook** = Running the compiled graph\n",
    "\n",
    "StateGraph is what ties everything together - without it, you'd just have disconnected nodes and no way to orchestrate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Edges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand StateGraph, let's talk about how nodes connect together. That's where **edges** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges** are connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution. They tell your application which node should be executed next after the current one completes its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of edges like **API call sequences in configuration workflows**. Imagine your SCM configuration workflow as a series of API calls that must happen in order - you can't create an address object before validating the input, and you can't verify creation before making the create call. Each step depends on the previous one completing successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph:\n",
    "- The **API operations** = Nodes (validate, prepare, create, verify)\n",
    "- The **call sequence** = Edges (connections defining order)\n",
    "- The **configuration data** = State (flowing through the workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges ensure your state flows from one processing step to the next in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connections**: Link nodes together to define workflow sequence\n",
    "- **Directional**: Flow goes from one specific node to another\n",
    "- **Determine Flow**: Control which node executes next\n",
    "- **Two Types**: Simple edges (always follow the same path) and conditional edges (dynamic routing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Edges Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Without edges:\n",
    "- Nodes would be disconnected and isolated\n",
    "- You'd have to manually orchestrate the execution order\n",
    "- No way to define the workflow sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "With edges:\n",
    "- Workflow sequence is explicit and visual\n",
    "- State automatically flows from node to node\n",
    "- Easy to modify the workflow by changing edges"

    "### 4.2 Understanding START and END\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we connect nodes with edges, let's understand two special elements: **START** and **END**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**START** is a virtual entry point in LangGraph that marks where the workflow begins. It's important to note that START doesn't perform any operations itself - it simply serves as the designated starting position for the graph's execution. Think of it like the **beginning of your configuration playbook** - it's where you open the document and start following the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**END** signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph. When the application reaches this point, the graph's execution completely stops, indicating that all intended processes have been completed. This is like reaching the **final step in your playbook** - the configuration change is complete and there's nothing more to do.\n",
